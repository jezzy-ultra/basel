- [ ] generate palette table (with a column for the slots that use the swatches)
      in readmes
- [ ] give `SCHEME` an ascii fallback too. (also check it for length?)
- [x] check `Meta` fields for length
- [ ] print more logs by default
- [ ] if an undefined slot is used as a value in a scheme, ask the user if they
      meant to prefix it with a `$` in the error message
- [ ] rethink slot design around headings and rainbow punctuation
- [ ] put extra settings back into the kitty template?
- [ ] add json schema for schemes?
